## What is Shelly Gas?

### A Smart Gas Sensor

Many home appliances rely on natural gas, yet few homes have gas leak detection systems—posing a potential safety hazard. The Shelly Gas detector comes in two variants: **Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)** or **Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)**, offering enhanced protection for your home and family. With its long lifespan, minimal sensitivity drift, and Wi-Fi connectivity, you can always stay informed about potential gas threats.

### Features

- No hub required  
- Two gas types available: LPG or CNG  
- Audible and visual alarm with app notifications  
- Flame-resistant enclosure  
- Seamless integration with all other Shelly devices  
- Compatible with Android, iOS, Amazon Alexa, and home automation platforms via MQTT, CoAP, and REST API  
- Easy to incorporate into Arduino projects for smart automation
