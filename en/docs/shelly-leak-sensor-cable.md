## Short Description

The Leak Sensor Cable detects water the moment it touches any part of the cable—not just a single point. Flexible and easy to install, it’s ideal for placement under appliances, along walls, or across larger areas requiring enhanced protection. Originally included with Shelly Flood Gen4, it's now available as a separate extension, enabling coverage up to 150 meters. Simply connect additional cables to protect every vulnerable area of your home with confidence.

## Main Features

- **Detects water along the entire length** for extended area protection  
- **Senses various water types**, including tap water, rainwater, air conditioning leaks, and fire protection water  
- **Expandable coverage** – connect multiple cables for up to 150 meters of continuous detection  
- **High sensitivity and fast response** powered by super-conductive materials  
- **Soft and flexible design** for quick, hassle-free installation  
- **Reusable and easy to maintain** – dry with a cloth and reuse after an alarm  

## Use Cases

- **Extend Flood Detection Across Large Areas**  
  Cover wide or irregular spaces such as basements, utility rooms, or entire wall lengths by connecting multiple Leak Sensor Cables for up to 150 meters of continuous leak detection.

- **Enhance Protection Around Multiple Appliances**  
  Run the cable along walls or behind multiple appliances—such as washing machines, dishwashers, and boilers—to monitor all at once, without needing individual sensors.

- **Upgrade Existing Setups with Extra Reach**  
  Expand the detection range of your Shelly Flood Gen4 by adding one or more Leak Sensor Cables, ensuring no corner is left unprotected.
