# Hono



## Developer Experience

Hono provides a delightful "**Developer Experience**".

Easy access to Request/Response thanks to the `Context` object. Moreover, Hono
is written in TypeScript. Hono has "**Types**".

For example, the path parameters will be literal types.


And, the Validator and Hono Client `hc` enable the RPC mode. In RPC mode, you
can use your favorite validator such as Zod and easily share server-side API
specs with the client and build type-safe applications.
